# Getting Started Guide for the ESP32

This is a get started guide for the Adafruit Huzzah ESP32 using [Micropython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/index.html). This chip is a great improvement on the already useful ESP8266, adding much more IO, and supporting both WiFi and Bluetooth.

Everything has been tested using the [Adafruit Huzzah32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405), but should work on other implementations of MicroPython on ESP32 (and most of this should also work on the ESP8266).
